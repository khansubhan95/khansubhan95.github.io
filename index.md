Hey! I'm Subhan. I am a full stack developer located in Chicago, Illinois.

I began software development while in College, where I mostly dabbled in web development using Python and Django. Around that time, I grew interested in the changes that were happening in JavaScript at the time and moved to Node.js and React. I also decided to invest in Java and learnt the Spring framework.

I have worked as an FPGA Verification Engineer at Wipro in the past. I graduated in ECE from Osmania University in 2017.

I am currently looking for a software engineer position, preferably in a full stack role. Here's my [**resume**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUXzMWQRzkEihO_o3TpTOUsb8oxNLeFh/view?usp=sharing).

My portfolio, with links to source code and demo versions, can be found [**here**](/portfolio).

You can also read my [**blog**](/blog) and [**subscribe**](/feed.xml) to it using a feed reader like feedly. [**Contact**](/contact) me to give any comments.
