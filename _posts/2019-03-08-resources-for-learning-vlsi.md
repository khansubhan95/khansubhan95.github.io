Unlike software, resources for learning VLSI are few and in between. Here is a collection of books and websites that I think will be really helpful.

## Books

* **SystemVerilog for Verification** by Chris Spear - I used this book for learning the basics of SystemVerilog
* **Verilog HDL** by Samir Palnitkar - a good introduction to the basics of Verilog HDL. The book is divided into three parts, read the first two.

## Websites

* [EDA playground](http://edaplayground.com/) - For running RTL and simulations. This website provides access to tools by multiple vendors.
* [Link](http://www.asic-world.com/) - For tutorials on Verilog, VHDL, SV, scripting
* [Link](http://www.vlsi-expert.com/p/content.html) - For static timing analysis concepts
* [Link](http://eda-automation.blogspot.in/) - For static timing analysis concepts
* [Link](http://www.testbench.in/) - For verification concepts
* [Link](http://vlsi.pro/) - For verification concepts
* [Verification Academy](https://verificationacademy.com/) - cookbooks, SV/UVM videosÂ etc
