I am Mohammed Subhan Khan, a VLSI engineer working in FPGA verification at Wipro Ltd. I graduated in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE) from Osmania University.

My job involves doing RTL(register transfer level) verification using SystemVerilog with UVM(Universal Verification Methodology). I also have some experience in writing RTL in Verilog HDL. Other skills include knowledge of protocols like HDMI, I2C etc. and debugging skills using simulators like NCSim. Other languages that I am interested in are C, C++ and Python. I also did some web development while in college, using Django and Node.js.

I use this blog to write about hardware, software and tech in general. Existing topics include commonly available hardware like Arduino and ESP8266, Web Development and Django. I am also planning to write on FPGAs, computer architecture and low level software programming in the coming weeks.
