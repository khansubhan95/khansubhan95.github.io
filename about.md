I am Mohammed Subhan Khan, and this is my blog where I write about programming.

My interest in programming is in Python, JavaScript and C and web frameworks like Node.js and Django.

I was previously a VLSI engineer working in FPGA verification at Wipro Ltd where I did RTL verification using SystemVerilog with UVM. I also have some experience in writing RTL in Verilog HDL. Other skills include knowledge of protocols like HDMI, I2C etc. and debugging skills using simulators like NCSim.

I graduated in ECE from Osmania University in 2017.
